**Pyro** is a parallelized incremental build system for _Skyrim Classic_ (TESV), _Skyrim Special Edition_ (SSE), and _Fallout 4_ (FO4) projects. Pyro provides mod authors with an all-in-one tool for compiling Papyrus scripts, packaging BSA and BA2 archives, and preparing builds for distribution. Pyro can be integrated as an external tool into any IDE, allowing mod authors to "Instant Build" projects with a single hotkey.
